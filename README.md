# FaceMask-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-CV

# Situation:
Why I am choosing this project? Here is the answer, The issue of wearing face mask in public comes up frequently these days. A common sentiment is, “If I am not personally at high risk for COVID-19 or OMICRON, why should I wear a mask?” I suspect this is why I see so many people in public places who are not covering their nose and mouth. The CDC has recommended “wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain like grocery stores and pharmacies. Especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

The reason for this is that the virus that causes COVID-19 or OMICRON can be spread even before symptoms appear, by such things as coughing, sneezing, or even speaking at close range. Cloth face coverings have been recommended due to their low cost and ready availability. By using cloth face coverings, it preserves surgical masks and N-95 masks for healthcare workers who may be involved in direct care of patients with COVID-19 or OMICRON.

The importance of using face coverings in public is illustrated in the graphic seen here. If I wear my face covering to protect you from me, and you wear your face covering to protect me from you, then we can all dramatically decrease our risk of transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19. This, in conjunction with social distancing and frequent handwashing or use of hand sanitizer, will be important in limiting the spread of COVID-19 as we return to our usual activities. 

# Objective:
 The main scope of  this project is to find the person who not wearing the mask. We have to aware the person about the spread of OMICRON, wearing masks is important. Protective masks are said to lower the chances of omicron virus entering our respiratory system through droplets that are present in the air. Wearing of masks is especially recommended for people living in densely populated areas. Its reduce the spread of the Virus.
 
 # Approach and Uses of this Project:
 By using this project, We find the person who is wearing mask or non. In future world we know that if we dont wear facemeask oviously cases are increase again. In US almost most of the places goes under lockdowns. So In future oviously  this project helpful for many Governments or private sectors.By using all the preprocessing steps like image generator our data is ready for models. I'll do more than 3 model to predict this data and comparing the models based on the accuracy of the model and for model performance based on the model loss metrics.

# Result:
By looking all the models in our project most of the models gives us the best accuracy and model loss like its almost gives 98% accuracy and low model loss.By looking this kind of model performance which means our preprocessing steps helps to increase the model performance. So we said that it gonna be predict the future data approximatley good only. which means if any new data and future data comes to our model we said that its Our model predict approximately.

Thank You.....
